**Assumptions**

- No login flow was needed: I assume this since this will require more time to develop and also all the endpoints will required authentication.
- I didn't use a global state since the app wasn't big

**Bonus Points**
- All the components are small and they are simple so Unit test wouldn't be difficult to implement

**Technical Dependencies and Libraries**

- React JS
- CSS
- ReactBootsrap
- Axios
- Visual Studio Code
- Git
